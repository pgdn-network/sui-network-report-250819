# VALIDATION

We **only** share per-node results (scores, categories, timestamps) after you **prove ownership** of the infrastructure included in our snapshot.

## How to start (required)

Email [**sm@pgdn.ai**](mailto:sm@pgdn.ai) with subject: `Ownership proof — <Your org / validator URL>` and include:

- Org / team name
- Validator URL(s) you believe are yours
- A technical contact (name + email)
- Your timezone / preferred window

We’ll reply with a unique **TOKEN** and the **exact steps** for a one-time ownership challenge.

*The method is tailored per operator/environment and is shared privately by email.*

## What the challenge is (at a high level)

- A short, non-invasive action from your validator environment that lets us confirm control of the machine/network we observed.
- Takes only a few minutes; no credentials are requested; no exploit activity is involved.

> Details of the challenge (how/when) are provided after we issue your TOKEN by email.
> 

## Privacy

- Operator identities and raw evidence are handled privately.
- Public materials remain **aggregate and anonymised**.
