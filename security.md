# SECURITY

## Responsible disclosure

- We publish **aggregate, anonymised** findings and share operator specific results solely to those who have validated ownership.
- If you believe our public artefacts expose sensitive information, contact us privately first. We’ll respond and, if needed, redact promptly.

## Reporting a security issue to [pgdn.ai](http://pgdn.ai/)

- Just email [simon@pgdn.ai](mailto:simon@pgdn.ai) while we’re in early access

## Safe-use policy (important)

- **Authorized targets only.** Do not point this tooling at assets you do not own or control without explicit permission.
- **External observation only; no exploits.** The OSS code should not perform invasive actions. If you find otherwise, open a security report.
- **Rate limits & guardrails.** Keep defaults conservative; do not bypass rate-limiters against third-party infrastructure.

## Legal
