# CONTACT

**We do not publish CVEs etc in public artifacts that can be associated with specific validator addresses.**

If you believe your infrastructure may be included in our snapshot or you want help: **email us.**

- Operators / owners: [**sm@pgdn.ai**](mailto:sm@pgdn.ai)

We are in the process of setting up a Discord and Telegram group.

## What to expect

- We will **not** share per-node results until you **prove ownership** (see [VALIDATION.md](validation.md)).
- Once validated, we can share your node’s **anonymised on-chain ID (node.uuid)**, the **score**, observation **categories**, timestamp, and a **remediation plan**.

## What we won’t do

- Share IPs/hosts or any per-node results **without** ownership validation.
- Discuss operator-specific details in public channels.
- Remove or alter on-chain records; we’ll publish **updated** scores after remediation is verified.

For validation methods and the exact steps, see [**VALIDATION.md**](validation.md).
